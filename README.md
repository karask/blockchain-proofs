# blockchain-proofs
Implementation for generating and validating blockchain proofs/receipts (for proof of existence). Currently it supports only [chainpoint v2](http://www.chainpoint.org/) but in the future it might incorporate other approaches like [OpenTimestamps](https://github.com/opentimestamps).
